# Hi there, I'm SOOMIN! 👋

I'm a student majoring in Korean Language Education and Library & Information Science.  
Recently, I started exploring the world of data — and it's been amazing so far!

### 🌱 I'm currently learning:
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Data visualization
- SQL (coming soon!)
- Git & GitHub

### 📌 Current Project:
- Analyzing university timetable data (check the repo below!)

### 📝 I like:
- Connecting data with real-world learning
- Visualizing what words and numbers can reveal together
- Making clean, clear project documentation (with a touch of blue!)

Feel free to check out my work or connect with me!
